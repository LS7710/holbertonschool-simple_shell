execute_command(3) - Execute a shell command

NAME
    execute_command - execute a shell command

SYNOPSIS
    #include "shell.h"

    int execute_command(char *cmd);

DESCRIPTION
    The execute_command function executes a shell command specified by the cmd argument.

RETURN VALUE
    Upon successful execution of the command, the function returns the exit status of the command.
    If an error occurs during execution, the function returns EXIT_FAILURE.

ERRORS
    The function may fail and set errno for the following reasons:
    
    EAGAIN - The system lacked the necessary resources to create another process, or the system-imposed limit on the total number of processes under execution system-wide or by the current user ID was exceeded.
    
    ENOMEM - Insufficient memory available for the system to allocate resources to execute the command.

EXAMPLES
    To execute a command in the shell, use the execute_command function as follows:
    
    #include "shell.h"

    int main(void) {
        char *line = NULL;
        size_t len = 0;
        ssize_t read;
        int status = 0;

        while ((read = getline(&line, &len, stdin)) != -1) {
            status = execute_command(line);
        }

        free(line);
        return status;
    }
